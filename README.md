# a_string and a_vector (asv)

A very simple dynamic string and vector impl in C.

# using

run make in this folder however you want, link against `asv.o` and include `a_vector.h`, `a_string.h` at your choosing.

# development

asv is **not stable** and will not have a stable abi for a very long time. As I write more software, this library will be continually developed until I deem it stable enough. Use at your own caution, this library is made for myself to use. I might write unit tests for this at some point.
